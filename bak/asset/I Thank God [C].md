  Verse 1:
    ^Wandering  into   the  night   ^Wanting a place to hide 
      This    ^weary soul, this ^bag of bones   
    ^I tried with all my might  But ^I just can't win the fight   
    I'm slowly ^drifting,    a     va^gabond 
    And   ^just when I ran ^out of road  I ^met a man I ^didn't know 
    And He ^told  me  that  ^I  was  not   a^lone 
    
  Chorus:
    He ^picked me up  ^Turned me around 
      ^Placed my feet on ^solid ground 
    I thank the ^Master  I thank the ^Savior 
    He ^healed my heart  He  ^changed my name 
    For^ever free,  I am  ^not the same 
    I thank the ^Master  I thank the ^Savior 
    I thank ^God

  Verse 2:
    ^I  cannot  dеny  what  I  see  ^Got no choice but to believе 
    My   doubts  are  ^burning  Like ashes in the ^wind 
    ^So long  to  my  old  friends  ^Burden and bitterness 
    You can just keep ^moving  you ain't welcome  ^here 
        ^From now till I walk the ^streets of gold  I'll ^sing of how you ^saved my soul 
    This ^wayward    son    has    ^found  his  way back  ^home 
  
  Bridge 1:
    ^Hell lost another one I am  free, I am  free, I am  free 
    
  Bridge 2:
    ^Hell lost another one  ^I am  free, ^I am  free, ^I am  free
